    "# An expression in programming is made up of one or more values, operators, and sometimes function calls or method invocations, combined in a way that produces a new value. Expressions can be simple, like a single value or variable, or they can be complex, involving multiple operations and values. Expressions are used to perform computations, manipulate data, and make decisions within a program.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 2. Operators: Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more values. They define how the values should be combined, compared, or transformed. Examples of operators include +, -, *, /, ==, <, and >.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Function Calls/Method Invocations: In many programming languages, expressions can include function calls or method invocations that return values. These values can be used as part of the expression. For example, len(\"hello\") is an expression where the len function is called to calculate the length of the string \"hello\".\n",

    "# 1. Perform Computations: Expressions can perform mathematical computations and operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, 3 + 5 is an expression that computes the sum of 3 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Combine or Manipulate Data: Expressions can concatenate strings, combine lists, or manipulate data in other ways. For example, \"Hello, \" + \"world\" is an expression that combines two strings to create a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Make Decisions: Expressions can be used in conditional statements and loops to make decisions based on the result of the expression. For example, in an if statement, the expression inside the parentheses determines whether the code block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Assign Values: Expressions can be used to assign values to variables. For example, x = 10 + y is an expression that calculates the sum of 10 and the value of variable y and assigns it to variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Create Complex Logic: Expressions can be combined to create more complex logic, allowing you to model intricate calculations and decision-making processes.\n",
